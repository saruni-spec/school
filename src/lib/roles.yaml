# Role Permissions Mapping

## Key Observations
1. We'll align the permissions with the `system_resource` and CRUD operations
2. We'll use privilege scopes to define the extent of each permission
3. We'll categorize roles using the `role_type` and `privilege_category`

## Implementation Notes
1. Use the `permission` model to granularly define each role's access
2. Leverage `scope` to control the extent of permissions
3. Use boolean flags (`can_admin`, `can_create`, etc.) for fine-grained access control
4. Consider using department, school, or facility IDs to further restrict permissions

## Recommendations
- Implement a hierarchical permission system
- Use role inheritance where possible
- Regularly audit and update role permissions
- Implement logging for critical administrative actions
